## Description

This project appears to be a backend application with features related to authentication, chat, notifications, gigs, payments, user management, and collaboration. (Further details to be filled in by the project maintainers).

## Installation

To install the dependencies, run:
```bash
yarn install
```
Then, create a `config.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. Refer to the project's source code or existing `config.env.example` (if available) for required variables.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in development mode.

### `yarn start:prod`
Runs the app in production mode.

### `yarn test`
Runs the tests (if any are configured). Currently, this script outputs "Error: no test specified".

### `yarn debug`
Starts the server with the Node.js debugger (`ndb`).

## API Endpoints

The backend provides a variety of API endpoints, broadly categorized as follows:

*   **Authentication:** Managing user login, registration, tokens, etc. (e.g., `/api/v1/auth`)
*   **Users:** User profile management, fetching user data, and related operations. (e.g., `/api/v1/users`)
*   **Applications:** Handling various application submissions or management. (e.g., `/api/v1/applications`)
*   **Gigs/Listings:** Managing gigs, services, or project listings. (e.g., `/api/v1/gigs`)
*   **Messaging/Chat:** Endpoints for real-time chat and message handling. (e.g., `/api/v1/messages`)
*   **Notifications:** Managing and dispatching user notifications. (e.g., `/api/v1/notifications`)
*   **Payments:** Processing payments and handling payment-related operations. (e.g., `/api/v1/payments`)
